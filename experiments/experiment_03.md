### **_Name_** 
experiment_3

### **_Location_** 
`/data/Ponc/VOS-ForeGAN/experiment_3/`

### **_Details_**
- We try a new way of combining A and C of Gf. We use the expression:

Ifg1 = A·Iw1 + (1 - A)·C

The interpretation of this expression is the following: A should learn to keep the information coming from Iw1 and C should learn what should be modified from Iw1.

- lambda_rec  = 10
- lambda_Df   = 10
- lambda_Dfgp = 5

### **_Results_**

:heavy_check_mark: Fake images generated by Gf & Gb look super real.

:heavy_check_mark: Generated foregrounds capture motion of the object, this did not happened before
:x: Generated foregrounds do not represent as good as before the appearance of the object, it looks kind of brighter...

:heavy_check_mark: Mask is learning what parts of the previous image should remain and what should be modified.
:x: Obviously, this mask is not the appropriated to mask the generated background because is not a mask that segment the foreground, is a mask that learns what information to keep from previous image.

:x: Gb did not learn that it had to impaint. In addition, since the foreground appearance was poor and the mask was bad, the background took part of the foreground to reconstruct the image (talk to octavia&xavi about gradients when backprop)

### **_Conclusions_**
- As a consequence of having increased the number of patches and lambda_Db, lambda_Dbgp, Gf did not generate real fgs, this fact misled Gb. In _experiment 3_ we will lower lambda_Db, lambda_Dbgp and set higher lambda_rec, lambda_Df, lambda_Dfgp. 
- Gf generates very strange things, this is probably a problem  of how C and A are combined, in this experiment:

A * (Iw1 + C) + [ (1 - A)*(Iw1 + C) - 1 ]

In this expression, we are expecting (Iw1 + C) to be the modified image and A to be directly the foreground mask. This is too much to ask from the model Gf. We'll modify this combination of C and A in experiment 3. 

- We'll keep with a lot of patches per image in the background.
