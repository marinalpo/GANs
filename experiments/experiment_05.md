### **_Name_** 
experiment_4

### **_Location_** 
`/data/Ponc/VOS-ForeGAN/experiment_9/`

### **_Details_**
- We keep the way of combining the A and C in Gf, but now we try to generate a mask out of the Ifg1 generated by Gf with a very simple conv layer (3..1) shared across timesteps.
- We increase T = 6, reduce N = 30, maintain a size of 64, 96 (64+32) in last features
- We introduce noise in the background and remove the optical flow from the the input of Gb, this should help the background to not generating part of the foreground.

- :warning: DISCUSS WITH OCTAVIA

- lambda_Db = 0.1, other lambdas = 1

- We generate the masks with a saturated sigmoid.

### **_Results_**

:x: The motion of the foreground in some cases is still not solved. It can't be generated properly. Should We think about another way of computing the Inext_fg? Cuidado que esto es el foreground ya masqueado... quiza el generado es un poco mejor

:heavy_check_mark: The masks look like a mask and capture the motion (sometimes). Should we saturate them more? Now 20

:heavy_check_mark: Since we increased the number of videos in training, the number of patches of the background also increased. This fact enriches the background distribution. The network **tries to impaint** for the first time and it generates promising results.

:warning: Discuss with octavia the problem of forward backward in autoregressive methods... should we change?

### **_Conclusions_**
- Discuss everything with octavia.
