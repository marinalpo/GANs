# GANs

## TODO

 * ~~(Easy) Write architecture patchgan (1h 15m)~~
 * ~~(Normal) Write function that returns patches~~
 * (Normal) Write dataloader so it gives REAL patches where there's no foreground
 * ~~(Difficult) Make G recurrent~~
 * ~~(Easy) Modify Generator's forward method to concat warps, ofs, images. Header: forward(self, img0m, of, img1w)~~
 * ~~(Easy) Set inputs method in ForestGAN~~
 * ~~(Easy) Mask warped images~~
 * (Normal) Implement forward of the whole GAN
 * (Difficult) Implement forward D
 * (Ultra difficult) Implement gradient penalty and optimize parameters
