# GANs

## TODO

 * ~~(Easy) Write architecture patchgan (1h 15m)~~
 * ~~(Normal) Write function that returns patches~~
 * ~~(Difficult) Make G recurrent~~
 * ~~(Easy) Modify Generator's forward method to concat warps, ofs, images. Header: forward(self, img0m, of, img1w)~~
 * ~~(Easy) Set inputs method in ForestGAN~~
 * ~~(Easy) Mask warped images~~
 * ~~(Normal) Implement forward of the whole GAN~~
 * ~~(Difficult) Implement forward D~~
 * (Normal & urgent) Write extract_real_patches so it gives REAL patches where there's no foreground
 * ~~(Ultra difficult) Implement gradient penalty and optimize parameters~~
